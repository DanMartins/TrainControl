# TrainControl
Train Control System, developed in LabVIEW (2005). This work was developed by Daniel de Oliveira Gatto, Danilo Oliveira Martins, Eric Arima Machado and Samir Mazzer Chuffi at [USJT](https://www.usjt.br/) (Brazil).

The population growth demands efficient and fast transportation systems, it is increasingly importantance for smart cities.
The automatic control of trains is required in order to optimize public mass transit nowadays.
In Brazil (2005) the train control systems was in general the application of block method which guarantees the safety of the process by protection the block where the train is detected (track circuit + antennas). However, it may not be the best solution for the performance of train control.
Developing a system which uses an external card capable of sending and receiving data, giving us the control and automation of trains in real time, is the proposal of our project.
Our intention is to optimize the trips allowing for a relevant increase in the demand of trains with security, efficiency, and speed.
To that end, we have used a supervisory software developed on the LabVIEW platform, a dedicated external signal acquisition card and electronic circuits for the individual control of each train. Through tests and simulation we have verified the achievement of the proposed goa,l and we believe that in the near future this idea can be use, to provide us with more efficient transportation.

## The code
The source code can be found here: [TrainControl](/code/realtrains.vi)
requires the hardware NI DAQ model CB-68LP and Software LabVIEW version 7.1.

## Experiment
To demonstrate the concept it was build a small scale plant:
